## Configure IP allow lists on internal applications and systems to allow interaction with GitHub-hosted runners

## List the effects and potential abuse vectors of enabling self-hosted runners on public repositories

## Select appropriate runners to support workloads (i.e. using a self-hosted versus GitHub-hosted runner, choosing supported operating systems)

## Contrast GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners

## Configure self-hosted runners for enterprise use (i.e. including proxies, labels, networking)

## Manage self-hosted runners using groups (i.e. managing access, moving runners into and between groups)

## Monitor, troubleshoot, and update self-hosted runners
